                <p>

                    Jessica's husband knew her family before she met him! Infact her father (also called Nick) was head of R&D where Nick (husband going to get confusing) was his second! Her father told her on her first day of work not to date anyone they work with....... well 10+ years later they are married with a Son!

                <p>
                    Jessica spends her time swimming as a mermaid whenever she can in her blue and green tail. If you cannot find her under the water or with her family she will be playing games. At the moment she is playing though Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
